        <h3>Watching Anime</h3>
        <p>I like watching anime because its fun and have interesting plot and plot twist. </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong>: Death Note:
        The story follows Light Yagami, a high school student who stumbles across a mysterious otherworldly notebook
        the "Death Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name
        and face he knows. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to change the world into
        a utopian society without crime and the subsequent efforts of L, a reclusive international criminal profiler,
        to apprehend him and end his reign of terror.</p>
        <p> <strong>Example # 2</strong>:Haikyuu:Inspired after watching a volleyball ace nicknamed "Little Giant" in action,
        small-statured Shouyou Hinata revives the volleyball club at his middle school. The newly-formed team even makes it to a tournament;
        however, their first match turns out to be their last when they are brutally squashed by the "King of the Court," Tobio Kageyama.</p>
